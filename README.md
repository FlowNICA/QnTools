# QnTools
Framework provides methods for applying an iterative data-based correction procedure explored in the paper [Effects of nonuniform acceptance in anisotropic flow measurements](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.77.034904). 
It extends the functionality of [FlowVectorCorrections](https://github.com/FlowCorrections/FlowVectorCorrections).
In Addition it provides methods to correlate the corrected Qn-Vectors. It integrates with the ROOT RDataFrame.

## How to build
Requirements:
- ROOT 6.20 (with MathMore)
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.8
